 **Project Description**
 This project aims to modernize a local library's system for managing books, borrowings, users, and payments. Currently, the library's processes are outdated, relying on manual, paper-based tracking with no digital inventory system and only cash payments. The goal is to create a web-based system that simplifies administration, allows users to manage borrowings online, and supports digital payments via Stripe.
